# Effect of Coffee/Caffeine Intake on Productivity ☕
###### PROJECT FOR DSA 210 SPRING TERM 2025 - YASEMİN ÖZKAN 34400

### INTRODUCTION

In todays social structure which has not enough time for sleep, coffee has become almost everyones "wake up" essential. 
Many students and workers rely on coffe to increase their productiveness.
And while we know that caffeine may suppress the need for sleep;there is no concrete evidence spporting the corelation of coffee/caffeine and productiveness.
Does it really work as we think?

This project aims to analyze the corelation between coffee/caffeine intake and productiveness using self collected data.
After racking the mg of caffeine intake and the hours studied necessary data science techniques will be apllies to the colected data to see if there 
is a relationship between caffeine intake and productivity: And if there is what may be the optimal amount of caffeine.

### RESEARCH QUESTION

Does caffeine intake effect productivity? And if it does; in what way?

### METHODOLOGY
#### DATA COLLECTION & PREPROCESSING

This study will collect data on both coffee intake and productivity metrics through self-tracking.

##### What are the things that are going to be tracked?
- The amount of caffeine consumed
- The time that caffeine consumed
- Hours studied and their time intervals
- Each study sessions productivity; self-rated (1-10)
- Hours slept
- Number of breaks taken in a session

The data collection ,given the circumstances, is expected to be *non-standart*; caffeine might be taken at different times, etc.
In order to get the cleanest usage from such a data set the 'study session' after or during the coffee intake will be measured for productivity instead of the whole day.
There might be multiple study sessions during the day. 

The collection for now will be manual; but if possible an app like structure is planned to be used.

#### PROCESSING THE DATA

##### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Descriptive statistics** (mean, median, standard deviation) will be used to summarize caffeine consumption and productivity metrics.
- **Data visualization** to uncover patterns and correlations will be used.
  
##### Hypothesis Testing
- **Null Hypothesis:** "Caffeine intake has no impact on productivity"
- **Alternative Hypothesis:** Caffeine intake positively (or negatively) affects productivity.

### EXPECTED OUTCOMES

The study aims to provide insights into:
- The correlation (if any) between caffeine intake and productivity.
- Whether higher caffeine consumption leads to better or worse productivity.
- The optimal caffeine intake level for maximizing focus and work efficiency.

### CONCLUSION
This project will use data analysis methods we learned in class to see if there is a relation between coffe intake and productivity.
The data will be self-collected and mainly phyton will be used for visualization and other types of data processing.
